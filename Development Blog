Development goal: Try to circle detection in 3D and estimate detection quality.
Functions need to add:
    For each x,y,z spot detected
    Add one Yellow circle at neighboring plane
    Add one Magenta circle at the plane detected
    Create a tiff file
    Merge channels and output as a merged Image
